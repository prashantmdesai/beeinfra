.SYNOPSIS
    Complete startup and provisioning of PRODUCTION environment resources from zero state.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script implements the production environment startup requirements from infrasetup.instructions.md
    by provisioning a enterprise-grade, high-availability production environment with paramount security,
    performance optimization, and comprehensive monitoring for business-critical operations.

    REQUIREMENTS COMPLIANCE:
    =======================
    This script implements requirements 7-9 and 10-13 from infrasetup.instructions.md:
    - Requirement 7: Ready 'startup' script that creates all production resources from zero
    - Requirement 8: Terminal/Azure CLI executable startup scripts
    - Requirement 9: Complete infrastructure creation from nothing
    - Requirement 10: Production Environment with enterprise features and autoscaling
    - Requirement 11: Production database managed service (100% capacity)
    - Requirement 12: Production paramount security configuration
    - Requirement 13: Production performance and availability optimization

    PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ARCHITECTURE:
    ===================================
    The production environment provisions enterprise-grade infrastructure including:
    - Premium P2V3 App Services with aggressive autoscaling (2-10 instances)
    - Premium Container Apps with high-performance autoscaling for API services
    - Azure Database for PostgreSQL (managed service, D4s high-performance tier)
    - Premium Container Registry with geo-replication and vulnerability scanning
    - Premium Storage with CDN integration and lifecycle management
    - Premium Key Vault with HSM protection and soft-delete for business secrets
    - Application Gateway Premium with Web Application Firewall (Prevention mode)
    - DDoS Protection Standard for network-level attack prevention
    - Private endpoints for all data services with zero-trust networking
    - Comprehensive monitoring with Azure Sentinel for security analytics
    - Developer VM with production support tools and secure access

    PARAMOUNT SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION:
    =================================
    Per requirements, production security is of paramount importance:
    - All web traffic enforced to HTTPS with Extended Validation SSL certificates
    - Azure Key Vault Premium with HSM protection stores all business-critical secrets
    - User-assigned managed identities with principle of least privilege RBAC
    - Network Security Groups with zero-trust principles and custom rules
    - Web Application Firewall in Prevention mode with OWASP rule sets
    - Private endpoints for all data services preventing public internet access
    - Advanced Threat Protection with real-time alerts to prashantmdesai@yahoo.com
    - Azure Security Center Premium tier with continuous security monitoring
    - DDoS Protection Standard with automatic attack mitigation
    - Azure Sentinel for security information and event management (SIEM)

    HIGH AVAILABILITY AND PERFORMANCE:
    =================================
    Production environment optimized for business continuity:
    - Autoscaling configured for production load patterns (2-10 instances)
    - Database configured for high availability with automatic failover
    - Application Gateway with multiple backend pools for redundancy
    - Storage accounts with geo-redundant replication
    - CDN integration for global content delivery and performance
    - Health probes and automatic recovery for all services
    - Load balancing across multiple availability zones

    ENTERPRISE COST MANAGEMENT:
    ==========================
    Production balances performance requirements with cost optimization:
    - Aggressive autoscaling reduces costs during off-peak hours
    - Reserved instance pricing where applicable for cost savings
    - Storage lifecycle policies for automated cost optimization
    - Budget alerts set at $30/month with dual monitoring and escalation
    - Comprehensive cost tracking and optimization recommendations

    Estimated monthly cost: $138.72 with full enterprise features
    Cost breakdown:
    - App Service Premium P2V3: ~$70/month (with autoscaling)
    - PostgreSQL D4s: ~$35/month (high-performance managed service)
    - Container Apps Premium: ~$15/month (production load)
    - Storage, CDN & Networking: ~$8/month
    - Security & Monitoring Premium: ~$10.72/month

    BUSINESS CONTINUITY:
    ===================
    Production environment includes comprehensive business continuity:
    - Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
    - Disaster recovery procedures with RTO/RPO requirements
    - Monitoring and alerting for all critical business functions
    - Incident response procedures with escalation paths
    - Business impact analysis and recovery prioritization

    PRODUCTION STARTUP SEQUENCE:
    ===========================
    The script follows a carefully orchestrated deployment order:
    1. Resource Group and enterprise networking foundation
    2. Premium Key Vault with HSM and enterprise security
    3. High-availability database and storage with private endpoints
    4. Premium Container Registry with geo-replication
    5. Premium App Services and Container Apps with autoscaling
    6. Application Gateway Premium with SSL and WAF Prevention mode
    7. DDoS protection and advanced security monitoring
    8. Enterprise monitoring, alerting, and budget controls
    9. Production developer VM with support tools
    
    Total deployment time: 15-25 minutes for complete enterprise environment.

    PRODUCTION SAFETY MEASURES:
    ==========================
    This script includes production-specific safety measures:
    - Confirmation prompts for all destructive operations
    - Validation checks before proceeding with each deployment step
    - Rollback procedures in case of deployment failures
    - Comprehensive logging of all deployment activities
    - Health checks and validation after each major component deployment

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip confirmation prompts (use with extreme caution - production changes require approval)

.PARAMETER BudgetOverride
    Override default $30 budget limit (requires business justification)

.PARAMETER SkipSecurityValidation
    Skip security validation steps (NOT RECOMMENDED for production)

.EXAMPLE
    .\complete-startup-prod.ps1
    .\complete-startup-prod.ps1 -Force  # Use with extreme caution
    .\complete-startup-prod.ps1 -BudgetOverride 50  # Requires business justification
#>

    [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
    [switch]$SkipSecurityValidation = $false  # Skip security validation (NOT RECOMMENDED)
